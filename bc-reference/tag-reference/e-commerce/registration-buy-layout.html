  <li>This layout is used for the Check Out form. Users get to this form as the final step of the shopping experience after clicking the checkout button outputted by the {tag_buybutton} tag found on the <a href="/dev-assets/reference/tag-reference/e-commerce/shopping-cart-layout.html">shopping cart</a> layout.</li>

<h2>Accessible from</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Admin Console:</strong>Â Site Manager &gt; Module Templates &gt; Online Shop Layouts</li>
  <li><strong>SFTP &amp; Develop Mode:</strong>  /Layouts/OnlineShop/order_registration-XX.html
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Replace "XX" with the country code you have added in the Site Settings &gt; Site Domains panel (see the "Country" column).
</p>
<p>
If you have multiple domains with different "Country" values you will find multiple order-registration-XX files, one for each country.
This way, with one layout for every country defined you can vary the contents of the layout to accomodate a multilingual website.
